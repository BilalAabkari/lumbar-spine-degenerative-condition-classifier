# lumbar-spine-degenerative-condition-classifier

This is an image IA classifier made for a Kaggle competition to develop a model that can be used to aid in the detection and classification of degenerative spine conditions using lumbar spine MR images.

Given an image, it predicts the probability for each disc to have a specific degenerative condition. More details [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-2024-lumbar-spine-degenerative-classification).

Data trained: 30Gb of MR images
Best accuracy: 85%
